Computational work with LANL collaborators Sergei Tretiak and Amanda Neukirch has been published in [Nano Letters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c03320)

We predict a mechanism for decreasing exciton binding energies in two-dimensional materials. 
Here we focus on monolayer lead-halide perovskites and modifying the organic layer such that they introduce acceptor states inside the perovskite fundamental gap. 

If the perovskite layer can couple to the acceptor state (i.e., mixing in charge-transfer character to the exciton), it can take advantage of the reduced ionization threshold, which consequently reduces the binding energy.


This work will be presented at APS March Meeting 2023.
